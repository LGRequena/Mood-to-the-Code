            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Our goal is to be as transparent as possible with our clientele. By eliminating the use of synthetic textiles in our production, we will establish change across the textile and fashion industry. Using sustainable plants and farms to produce textiles that are environmentally safe and 100% biodegradable. With each product that is listed we will list the kind of fabric, the source and production to ensure our transparency to you. Our designs are unique to our brand by collaborating with artists who you may know from comics to video game design.</p>
